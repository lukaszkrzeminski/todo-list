# A simple To do list

## A website that allows you to create a task list: add new tasks to do, mark them as done or delete them.

### Description
It's a simple page where user can add / check / delete tasks to do. In this project I practiced the basic usage of flex. for the first time I implemented Mediaquery. I also improved my skills to build simple js functions. Greatest difficulty for me was to add tasks list with check and remove buttons in js.
